The 7th ICES/PICES Zooplankton Production Symposium was held in Hobart, Australia, 17-22 March 2024. Very luckily I had the opportunity to stay in the area after PS140 EASI-2 to make this my first conference visit. I attended with both a presentation and a poster, both works from my masters degree.
