I am a PhD student at UTAS and IMAS, supervised by Pier van der Merwe, Ashley Townsend, and Pearse Buchanan . In my research project "Cryspheric sources of tracel metals along the Antarctic margins" I will collect observational data from two regions in Antarctica (Denman Glacier, and King Haakon VII Sea) and quantify the glacier input of trace metals in both regions. With this data, we aim to improve quantification of the total glacier melt input around Antarctica using World Ocean Models of Biogeochemistry And Trophic dynamics.

## Updates
**February 2025:** Excited to start my HDR candidature at the Institute of Marine and Antarctic Studies and the University of Tasmania!

**October 2024:** I assisted during multiple practicals within the MSc degree Freshwater and Marine Science, exploring CTD data using ODV, dating at sediment by looking at calcifying plankton distributions, and zooplankton diversity.

**April 2024:** I presented some early phytoplankton incubation results from PS140 to Antarctica on the NL Polar Day in the Hague. It was a day filled with Polar science, very happy to see the interests growing in the Netherlands.

**February 2023:**  I spent over 3 weeks at sea in the South Atlantic on *RV Pelagia*. [Here](https://www.nioz.nl/en/blog/64pe513-blog-the-beyond-expedition) you can read more about the research and our experiences on board.
